  <h1> Greninja </h1>
  <h2>Gen 6 (Kalos) </h2>
  <p> Greninja was introduced in Gen 6 or Kalos along with the other starters Fennekin and Chespin as starter pokemon.<br> His pre-evolution frokie is among one of the cutest pokemon in my opinion.<br> Frogadier Greninja's middle evolution is like a teenager as most middle evolution's. It is an upgrade from frokie. It is pretty fast with a base speed of 97. Now finaly we have greninja with him being a mixed attacker with 95 attack and 103 special attack. With his signature move water shuriken with priority and hitting multiple times it can hit pretty hard. Not to mention it's hidden ability Protean which makes every move stab moves like U-turn, Gunk shot, and Ice beam even more potent.Greninja is a very fast pokemon with a base speed of 122. It was realtivley good in competetive pokemnon but in Gen 7 our next section is when it really rises. Greninja may be very frail but it can be very versitile. It outspeeds most of it's oppenets and makes quick work of them. And underneeth this is Greninja's cry if you want to take a listen. </p>
